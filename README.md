August is an ideal time for bike riding in a northern climate. The weather is warm, and people spend more time outside, so bike usage is high. This visualization looks at peak hours of use. Daylight times have a significantly higher user rate than dark hours, especially early morning. If maintenance or reorganization of bikes between docking stations needs to take place, recommended time for these actions are between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM.
